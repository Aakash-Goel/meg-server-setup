 * For ex:
 *  1. create new folder inside 'src' i.e. 'featureXyz'
 *  2. create new file i.e. 'resolvers.js' inside 'src > featureXyz'. Create resolvers related to this feature only and export it.
 *  3. create new file i.e. 'index.js' inside 'src > featureXyz'. Import and Export `featureXyzResolvers` in this index file.
 *  4. Import here in 'rootResolver.js' i.e. const { featureXyzResolvers } = require('./src/featureXyz')
 *  5. Add it to the `rootResolver` i.e. const rootResolver = [<otherResolvers>, featureXyzResolvers]
